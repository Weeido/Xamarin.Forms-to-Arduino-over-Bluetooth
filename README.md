# Xamarin.Forms-to-Arduino-over-Bluetooth
A complete mobile cross-platform xamarin app architecture with basic bluetooth implementations to Arduino Bluetooth communication.


This toturial is meant to demonstrate architectural guidelines and provide a fast start up code for bluetooth.


Each platform has specific Interfaces and implementations for Bluetooth communication, therefor, in order to achieve flexible and reusable code, a OOP design is mandatory.

Design Notes:
This code is meant as a bootstrap for fast start up, it is by no means idealy written and is supposed to be edited and changed according to youre project.

The entire project architecture:

The project has two main parts which we'll be explained seperatly:
the first is the Blue
